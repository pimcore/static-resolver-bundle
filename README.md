# static-resolver-bundle
static-resolver-bundle is designed to encapsulate the usage of static calls within a more robust and testable service-oriented architecture.
It provides a straightforward, seamless mechanism to transform static methods into injectable services. 
By doing so, it enhances testability, simplifies code maintenance, and enforces better coding standards, promoting a cleaner, more consistent, and well-organized codebase.
